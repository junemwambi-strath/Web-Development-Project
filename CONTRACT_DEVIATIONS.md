# CONTRACT_DEVIATIONS.md

No deviations from `openapi.yaml`.

During Week 5 verification, two implementation bugs were found and fixed to
match the existing contract — the contract itself was not changed.

1. **Missing route** — `GET /workers/{id}` was not implemented in
   `server/routes/workers.js` at all (only `GET /workers` existed). We added the
   handler back, returning the full `WorkerProfile` shape already defined in
   `openapi.yaml` (`id`, `name`, `jobType`, `location`, `rating`,
   `ratePerHour`, `experienceYears`, `reviews`).

2. **Timezone drift on date fields** — `scheduledFor` and `createdAt` in
   booking responses were shifting by the local server timezone offset (EAT,
   UTC+3) instead of returning UTC as the contract promises. For example, a
   booking sent with `scheduledFor: "2026-09-15T09:00:00Z"` was coming back
   as `"2026-09-15T06:00:00.000Z"` — a silent 3-hour drift. Fixed by setting
   `timezone: '+00:00'` on the MySQL connection pool in `server/db.js`, so
   date columns are read back as UTC rather than being reinterpreted in the
   server's local timezone.

3. **Type drift on numeric fields** — `rating` and `ratePerHour` in worker
   responses were being returned as strings (e.g. `"4.8"`, `"800.00"`)
   instead of numbers, due to how the `mysql2` driver reads `DECIMAL`
   columns by default. Fixed by explicitly casting both fields with
   `Number()` before sending the response, in both `GET /workers` and
   `GET /workers/{id}`.

All three GET endpoints (`GET /workers`, `GET /workers/{id}`,
`GET /bookings/{id}`) were re-verified against `openapi.yaml` after these
fixes, field by field, in Swagger Editor's preview and via direct browser
requests. All field names, types, and status codes now match the contract.
